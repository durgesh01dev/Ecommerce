1. Created two js files namely app.js and server.js

2. now initialize the nodejs project
npm init

{
  "name": "ecommerce",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "e-commerce application using MERN stack",
  "main": "backend/server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/durgesh01dev/Ecommerce.git"
  },
  "author": "durgesh kumar",

3. install express, mongoose, and dotenv dependencies
npm i express mongoose dotenv

4. significance of gitignore files
https://careerkarma.com/blog/gitignore/

5. Configuring port number using dotenv
https://www.dotenv.org/docs/how-to/use-dotenv-with-express

6. installing nodemon
=> for automatic restarting the node application whenever the file changes.
=> https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon

7. Adding attributes in package.json within the scripts key
"start": "node backend/server.js",
"dev" : "nodemon backend/server.js"

8. Making routes and controllers folder within the backend folder
9. undefined value for port number
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71170213/server-port-undefined-in-node

Current url path is:
http://localhost:4000/api/v1/products

10. connecting the mongoDB database
=> The connectDatabase defined within the database.js file is responsible for connecting the mongoDB along with the server.
=> The databse url is defined dotenv file named  config.env as-
DB_URI = "mongo://localhostL27017/Ecommerce"
=> The parsing error with the DB_URI arises
//MongoParseError: Invalid scheme, expected connection string to start with "mongodb://" or "mongodb+srv://"
FIXED by using mongodb in DB_URI.

=> Error, MongoParseError: option usecreateindex is not supported at parseOptions 
The mongoose version used is 6.7, here  useNewUrlParser, useUnifiedTopology, useFindAndModify, and useCreateIndex are always true and .useFindAndModify is false. No need to use them explicitly in code
FIXED by
-> https://namespaceit.com/blog/mongoparseerror-options-usecreateindex-usefindandmodify-are-not-supported

=> Error, MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017
-> This means mongodb is not started yet, first start it., DB_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/Ecommerce" did not work 
->The url approach worked as- 
  DB_URI = "mongodb://127.0.0.1/Ecommerce"


11. MAKING ROUTES NOW
A. First make product model, productModel.js
productSchema developed having attributes like 
  name,  description,  price,  rating,
  images is array of object which comprises internal properties for public_id, and url fields,
  category,  Stock  numOfReviews,
  reviews is array of object which comprises name, rating, comment,
  createdAt

12. productController.js file
i. import the productModel.js
ii. define method to createProduct by storing the product details from the request body.
iii. This call is async-await, since it can take any number of time.
iv. Provide the route to create a new product in Ecommerce database, within the productRoute.js file
-> router.route('/product/new').post(createProduct);
v. Required url is 
http://localhost:4000/api/v1/products/new

13. Api calls for createProduct and getAllProducts are working fine.
Duplicate products are also stored for now.
